# hello-world

Hello,

My name is Zach, I am 28 years old. I am a land surveyor and contruction technician. 
I have a slight background in industrial electricity - PLC's, frequency drives, 4-20ma/0-10v circuits, etc.
I just built my first qav250. Very exciting to build, definitely a noob at flying...
Building it went smooth and steady, flying not so much! Anxious to learn to fly and to build a 170mm or 180.
